  <p>Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text</strong> of the printing and typesetting 
    industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text
    ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
    type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
    sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
    desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
    versions of Lorem Ipsum.</P>
